# Contributing to Vester

Hello! We're always happy to hear from friends old and new. Here's some basic info about contributing for newcomers.

## Your First Contribution

If you're a first-timer, welcome! If you're not sure how to GitHub, allow me to humbly recommend a [GitHub 101] guide I wrote to try to help.

Fixing typos or updating outdated documentation is always welcome. New sets of eyes are a very scarce resource :slightly_smiling_face:

If you're submitting anything more substantial, we'd love if you would open an issue with your bug or feature request first, and then describe your pull request as resolving a single issue.

Vester is designed so that Someone Like Youâ„¢ could [Write Your Own Vester Test]. If you have a small value in your vSphere environment you want to test for, we'd love to add more tests to the suite.
